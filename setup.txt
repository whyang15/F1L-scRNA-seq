To set up environments for this analysis:

1. Install scanpy.
    a. Open a terminal.  Use conda to install scanpy.
        ```
        conda install -c conda-forge scanpy python-igraph leidenalg
        pip3 install scanpy
        ```

2. Create a conda environment that includes scanpy.
    Open a terminal.  Due to issue on my Mac where Conda is failing to load the `libmamba` solver backend due to a missing `libarchive` library, 
    I have to solve this by forcing to use the classic solver by specifying it directly in the command:
        ``` conda create -n scrna python=3.9 --solver=classic  ```

3.  Activate the environment.

    ``` 
    conda activate scrna
    ```

4.  Install packages we need.
    ```
    pip install notebook scanpy doubletdetection
    ```

5.  Go to working directory and start jupyter notebook.
    ```
    cd /Users/weihsienyang/Desktop/FigureOneLab /kinker
    jupyter notebook
